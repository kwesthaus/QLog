# QLog

QLog is an Amateur Radio logging application for Linux, Windows. It
is based on the Qt framework and uses SQLite as database backend.

QLogs aims to be as simple as possible, but to provide everything the operator expects from the log to be. This log is not currently focused on contests.

## Command-Line ADIF Export

QLog can export contacts to ADIF without opening the main window.

The CLI export uses the same database and the same single-instance rule as the GUI, so it will fail if another QLog instance is already running.

Basic usage:

`qlog export --output /tmp/qlog-export.adi`

Write to standard output instead of a file:

`qlog export --stdout > /tmp/qlog-export.adi`

Apply the basic export filters from the dialog:

`qlog export --output /tmp/april.adi --date-from 2026-04-01 --date-to 2026-04-30 --my-callsign N0CALL --my-grid FN31`

Export only contacts with a QSO ID greater than a specific value:

`qlog export --output /tmp/newer.adi --min-qso-id 5000`

Export only newer contacts and write the maximum exported QSO ID to a file:

`qlog export --output /tmp/newer.adi --min-qso-id 5000 --max-qso-id-file /tmp/qlog-last-id.txt`

Use a saved user-defined filter from QSO Filters:

`qlog export --output /tmp/filtered.adi --user-filter "Worked POTA"`

Combine a station profile with a saved user-defined filter:

`qlog export --output /tmp/profile-filtered.adi --station-profile Home --user-filter "DX Only"`

QSL-oriented export filters are also available:

`qlog export --output /tmp/qsl.adi --type qsl --qsl-send-via bureau --qsl-include-no --qsl-include-invalid`

Available CLI export options:

- `export` enables command-line ADIF export mode.
- `--output <path>` writes ADIF output to a file.
- `--stdout` writes ADIF output to standard output.
- `--date-from <YYYY-MM-DD>` and `--date-to <YYYY-MM-DD>` enable date range filtering.
- `--min-qso-id <id>` exports only contacts with `id > <id>`.
- `--max-qso-id-file <path>` writes the maximum exported QSO ID to a file and requires `--min-qso-id`.
- `--station-profile <name>` filters by station profile.
- `--my-callsign <callsign>` filters by station callsign.
- `--my-grid <grid>` filters by my gridsquare.
- `--user-filter <name>` applies a saved user-defined QSO filter.
- `--type <generic|qsl>` selects generic export filtering or QSL-oriented filtering.
- `--qsl-send-via <B|D|E|bureau|direct|electronic|blank>` filters QSL exports by send-via value.
- `--qsl-include-no` includes `qsl_sent = N` in QSL exports.
- `--qsl-include-invalid` includes `qsl_sent = I` in QSL exports.
- `--qsl-include-sent` includes `qsl_sent = Y` in QSL exports.

## Compilation

### General

Prerequisites

- Installed Qt
- Installed [qtkeychain-devel](https://github.com/frankosterfeld/qtkeychain) library and headers
- Installed [OpenSSL-devel](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) libraries and headers
- Installed [HamLib-devel](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/releases/latest) libraries and headers

`qmake` supports listed input parameters that affect the compilation process.

- `HAMLIBINCLUDEPATH` - the path to Hamlib Includes 
- `HAMLIBLIBPATH` - the path to Hamlib Library 
- `HAMLIBVERSION_MAJOR` - Hamlib version - major number (must be present if `pkg-config` cannot determine Hamlib version)
- `HAMLIBVERSION_MINOR` - Hamlib version - minor number (must be present if `pkg-config` cannot determine Hamlib version)
- `HAMLIBVERSION_PATCH` - Hamlib version - patch number (must be present if `pkg-config` cannot determine Hamlib version)
- `PTHREADINCLUDEPATH`  - the path to pthread Includes - needed for Windows Hamlib 4.5 and later. Leave empty if system libraries should be used.
- `PTHREADLIBPATH` - the path to pthread Library - needed for Windows Hamlib 4.5 and later. Leave empty if system libraries should be used.
- `QTKEYCHAININCLUDEPATH` - the path to QtKeyChain Includes 
- `QTKEYCHAINLIBPATH`- the path to QtKeyChain Library
- `ZLIBINCLUDEPATH` - the path to ZLIB Includes
- `ZLIBLIBPATH` - the path to ZLIB Library

Leave variables empty if system libraries and Hamlib version autodetect (calling `pkg-config`) should be used during compilation (for Windows, the parameter must be present)

An example of use:

`
C:/Qt/6.4.1/msvc2019_64/bin/qmake.exe C:\Users\devel\development\QLog\QLog.pro -spec win32-msvc "CONFIG+=qtquickcompiler" "HAMLIBINCLUDEPATH = C:\Users\devel\development\hamlib\include" "HAMLIBLIBPATH =  C:\Users\devel\development\hamlib\lib\gcc" "HAMLIBVERSION_MAJOR = 4" "HAMLIBVERSION_MINOR = 5" "HAMLIBVERSION_PATCH = 0" "QTKEYCHAININCLUDEPATH = C:\Users\devel\development\qtkeychain_build\include" "QTKEYCHAINLIBPATH = C:\Users\devel\development\qtkeychain_build\lib" && C:/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/jom/jom.exe qmake_all

`make`

### MacOS

In order to build QLog on MacOS, following prerequisites must be satisfied.

1. [Xcode](#xcode) command line tools
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
3. [Qt](https://www.qt.io) with QtCreator

##### Xcode

Xcode command line tools can be installed by issuing a command in command terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```

**N.B.:** This command doesn't install Xcode itself, however It will take some time to download and
install the tools anyway.

##### MacOS build

Last dependencies before building QLog are:

```
 brew install qt6
 brew link qt6 --force
 brew install hamlib
 brew link hamlib --force
 brew install qtkeychain
 brew install dbus-glib
 brew install brotli
 brew install icu4c
 brew install pkg-config
```

As soon as the steps above are finished, QLog source can be opened in QtCreator, configured, built and run.
QLog app (qlog.app) from the build artifacts folder can be later copied (`installed`) to `~/Applications` and
accessed via Spotlight search bar.

NOTE: if it is necessary then use `qmake` input parameters described above to affect compilation. The input parameter must be use in case when hamlib or qtkeychain is compiled from their source code repos.
